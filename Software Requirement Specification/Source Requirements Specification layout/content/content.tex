\chapter{Overall Description}
\label{Overall Description}

\section{Product Perspective}
FLMI serves as an automation tool for connecting to the campus network. It strives to eliminate the need to enter the user details, which is the username and password of a student or a member of the institute manually. FLMI also reduces the multiple steps required to authenticate and login to the campus firewall network. The application aims to remove user-generated issues such as the loss of the Keepalive window, forget passwords.
The application helps secure connectivity and worry-free access to the campus network. FLMI works on all mobile devices which run on the Android operating system.

\section{Product Features}
FLMI provides users the following features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Detect IP address and magic number: The application detects the IP address of the router of the WiFi network to which the mobile device is connected and receives the webpage containing the firewall portal. 
    \item Login: One tap of a button can log the user into a connected network. 
    \item Logout: The user can logout of a already logged in network using a button.
    \item Keepalive: The login of a user is maintained continuously by re-sending login requests after Keepalive time has expired. 
    \item Add, Delete or Edit multiple user accounts: Multiple usernames and passwords for connecting to the firewall can be stored in the database of the application.
    \item Set credentials preferences: Most recently used Account is stored as next account to be used for login.
    \item Log Keepalive history: User login history is stored in the database so if a user forgets to logout of a network he can know to which network he was last connected.
\end{itemize}

\section{Operating Environment}
FLMI requires an Android OS mobile device. An android device that can support basic dependencies of the application is expected for proper user experience.

\section{Design and Implementation Constraints}
FLMI is under the GNU General Public License Version 3.0, 2007. Everyone, that does or is going to develop or use FLMI, should agree and fully accept the terms of this kind of license. 

\section{User Documentation}
Any issues or questions related to the software can be asked by raising an issue on the github page of FLMI.
\href{https://github.com/Shahraaz/LoginManager}{\texttt{https://github.com/Shahraaz/LoginManager}}

\section{Assumptions and Dependencies}
FLMI is an android application it requires and mobile Android device to run. The Apk file has to be downloaded and installed on the device. Proper permissions should be granted when requested to the user to ensure the full functionality of the application. 

The device should be connected to a strong WiFi network with a firewall only then can the login and logout functionality be used. The device, once logged in from one network, cannot be logged out on another network.

\chapter{External Interface Requirements}
\label{External Interface Requirements}

\section{User Interfaces}

Using the application is relatively simple and intuitive. A user familiar with the primary android application interface and navigation skill should be able to understand all functionality provided by the application. Nothing additional is required.

\section{Hardware Interfaces}
The application should work on mobile devices which are based on the Android operating system. No additional hardware interfaces required.

\section{Software Interfaces}
The application should run on Android 5.0 and above. Android below 5.0 (Lolipop) might cause some undefined behavior. The android device should have the application installed and proper permissions granted. It should also have the ability to connect to a WiFi network using the system hardware. 

\section{Data Management Interfaces}
The application should be able to interact with other components in the android device according to their specifications. Its operating device also limits the application in terms of the maximum number of user accounts the device's database can store at a particular time.

The tables in the database are as follows:\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{images/table.png}

\section{Communications Interfaces}
There is a requirement of a working WiFi connection with a firewall setup and a valid user account in that firewall to use all of the functionality of the application. Additionally, an internet connection is required to download the application and update it. The only functionality available offline is the ability of the user to add multiple accounts and change passwords of an account.

\chapter{System Features}
\label{System Features}
The Priority ranges from 1 (most important) to 10 (least important).


\section{Fetch IP Address and Magic Number}
\subsection{Description and Priority}
The device would request a detect portal request though the Network. The network sends back a firewall login page back to the device requested.
Priority = 1.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Purpose} : The IP address indicates which network the user is connected to and the magic number indicates currently which user is connected to which network.
    \item \textbf{User} : The application sends a request.
    \item \textbf{Input Data}: request to detectportal.firefox.com.
    \item \textbf{Output Data}: Corresponding Page Data.
    \item \textbf{Invariants}: Device is connected to a network.
    \item \textbf{Pre-conditions}: The mobile device is not logged in to the network.
    \item \textbf{Post-conditions}: The page data of the firewall portal is sent to the application
    \item \textbf{Basic Flow}: The application sends a request for the firewall portal from the mobile device the firewall if the device is not already logged in to the network sends back data regarding the firewall portal page.
    \item \textbf{Alternative Flow(s)}: If the device is already logged in to the network the request doesn't return back anything.
    \item \textbf{Business Rules}: This allows the user to access the login portal.
\end{itemize}

\section{Login}
\subsection{Description and Priority}
The system sends a login request to the network portal. The network portal, upon receiving this then responds with either a keepalive page (indicating that the user was logged in) or with another login (indicating that the user wasn't authenticated).
Priority = 1. \\

    \item \textbf{Alternative Flow}: The system upon recieving the signal, if does not find a valid database, then informs the user by the use of the application's notification system to notify the user that the database was not working properly, and then given a way to contact us for modifications.
    \item \textbf{Business Rules}: This allows the applications to work efficiently and properly.
\end{itemize}


\chapter{Other Nonfunctional Requirements}
\label{Other Nonfunctional Requirements}

\section{Performance Requirements}
FLMI is a light application that needs very few system resources to work. It is designed not to delay the system from other key processes and the response time of the program is immediate. Performance might be affected when the application has to check through multiple user accounts to find a valid login id.

\section{Safety Requirements}
The application is open-source, and its source code is freely available on GitHub. Any bugs or issues can be raised on the repository page. The community fixes those bugs and issues on its next release cycle.

\section{Security Requirements}
FLMI requires write access to the android SQLite database to store the user account details. Passwords of the users are saved to a database in the mobile device storage. The user's KeepAlive history is stored in the database of the mobile device.

\section{Software Quality Attributes}
FLMI has a well defined and easy to use interface it can be used by both experts and typical users. However, users must already have a basic knowledge of the Android UI before using it.

%\chapter{Other Requirements}
%\label{Other Requirements}

% Add this in assumptions and dependencies
%The application requires to be connected to the same wifi network without which if logged in the user is locked in that network and would be unable to log out until he goes back to the same network. That is the only other requirement that is required.
